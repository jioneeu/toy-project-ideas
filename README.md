# Toy project ideas
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](#)

I always had hard time coming up with a toy (side) project to do.
So, regardless how simple or complex the "toy" project is, I'll add it to the list.

Feel free to contribute by adding your toy project.

If you're going to contribute, modify this `README.md` file with the following information:
```
- [NAME OF THE PROJECT](LINK TO THE CODE)
```

If you don't want to share your code, feel free to omit the link and just have the name with a brief explanation of the project.
